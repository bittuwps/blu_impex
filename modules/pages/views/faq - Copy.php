                  Every trip has an itinerary with lot of options simultaneously. Every individual has the right to explore various options. If any point of time, you feel like exploring the things by yourself, you have the freedom to travel solo after planning the schedule with the trip crafter.

                  When a trip is organized, a page for the trip is generated. On the page of the trip you can find all the people willing to join the trip. Also, there is information about the Trip-Crafter. You can know all the past trips organized by the Trip Crafter and also you can browse through the names and visit profiles to know the people who are going on the group.

                  The fun of travelling in groups is sharing of rooms. We recommend that you share the room with fellow travelers for better bonding and understanding. Somehow, if you wish to have a separate room anyway, that can be possible for additional amount depending upon the accommodation.
